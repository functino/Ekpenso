This is a simple website (formerly known as ekpenso.com) that allows it's users to create, edit and share Mindmaps.

To get up and running:
Go to configs/sql and import the dump.sql in your database. Change the settings in configs/database.php. This is a cakePHP app so maybe look at some cakePHP help resources.

The Mindmaps are viewed using the Mindmap Editor which can be found here: https://github.com/functino/Mindmap-Editor

PLEASE don't copy this code/webiste. It should only be considered as an example app to show how the Mindmap-Editor can be configured.
